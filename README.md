# Project 2: Shiny App Development

### [Project Description](doc/project2_desc.md)

![screenshot](output/Snipaste.png)

In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on the work of a **NYC government agency/program** of your choice using NYC open data released on the [NYC Open Data By Agency](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/) website. In particular, many agencies have adjusted their work or rolled out new programs due to COVID, your app should provide ways for a user to explore quantiative measures of how covid has impacted daily life in NYC from different prospectives. See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The **learning goals** for this project is:

- business intelligence for data science
- data cleaning
- data visualization
- systems development/design life cycle
- shiny app/shiny server

## Restaurant Safety Map
+ **Term**: Spring 2022
+ **Team #** Group 6
+ **Team members**: 
	+ Jiachen Liu
	+ Yinan Shi
	+ Xinran Wang
	+ Silvia Vlachou

+ **Project summary**: As Covid started spreading in the Big Apple a lot has changed. Health safety regulations have been imposed by the government and health awareness has increased among New Yorkers who are trying to protect themselves and their loved ones by social distancing. As a measure against Covid, the Department of Transportation has opened streets exclusively for cyclists and pedestrians and has allowed restaurants to have outside seating space. However, these past months New York has also seen a great increase in crimes. Our goal is to help New Yorkers find restaurants that have outside space, are near streets open for cyclists and pedestrians, and are in safe neighbourhoods. We would like to see everyone stay healthy and safe!
